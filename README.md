# Hi 👋, I'm Messadia Mohamed Ishak

### 🚀 Code, Creativity & Control 🎭

As a third-year computer science student at the Higher National School of Computer Science (ESI ex. INI), I thrive where logic meets imagination. Whether it's constructing immersive worlds in Unity with C# or engineering seamless web experiences with Django and the MERN stack, I treat development as both an art and a calculated strategy.

Game development feeds my instinct for storytelling and interaction, while web development gives me the space to shape systems that connect and evolve. I navigate both worlds with precision and curiosity, designing solutions that aren’t just functional, but dynamic and impactful.

Beyond the screen, I’m fluent in communication, negotiation, and anything that involves people—because great technology isn’t just about writing code, it’s about understanding those who use it.
